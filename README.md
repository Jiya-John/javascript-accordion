Coding from scratch - javascript-accordion

Use CSS to hide all accordion content by default.
Add a click event to each section title and log “open” to confirm it works.
Inside the event, identify which title was clicked and log it.
When clicked, toggle the visibility of that section’s content using an if‑statement.
Before showing the new section, hide all other accordion content.
